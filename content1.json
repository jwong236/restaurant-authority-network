While a valid licence, a common misconception is that along with this certificate he became the \"4th grandmaster\" of Shindō Yōshin-ryū.  This is inaccurate – the 3rd grandmaster (Tatsuo Matsuoka) actually outlived Ōtsuka by almost 8 years.\nJujutsu was not to become his primary art, however; in 1922, Ōtsuka began training in\nShotokan\nkarate under\nGichin Funakoshi\n, who was a new arrival in Japan.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n1\n]\nIn 1927, he also established a medical practice and specialised in treating martial arts training injuries.\n[\n1\n]\nBy 1928, Ōtsuka was an assistant instructor in Funakoshi's school. He also trained under\nChōki Motobu\nand\nKenwa Mabuni\n, and studied\nkobudo\n, around this time.\n[\n1\n]\nŌtsuka began to have philosophical disagreements with Funakoshi,\n[\n9\n]\nand the two men parted ways in the early 1930s.\n[\n1\n]\nThis may have come, in part, from his decision to train with Motobu. Funakoshi's karate emphasized\nkata\n, a series of movements and techniques linked by the fighting principles. Funakoshi did not believe that\nsparring\nwas necessary for realistic training. Motobu, however, emphasized the necessity of free application, and created a series of two-person\nkumite\ncalled\nyakusoku kumite\n.\n[\n10\n]\nWado-ryu karate\n[\nedit\n]\nOn April 1, 1934, Ōtsuka opened his own karate school the Dai Nippon Karate Shinko Kai at 63 Banchi Suehiro-Cho,\nKanda\n, Tokyo.\n[\n1\n]\nHe blended Shotokan karate with his knowledge of Shindō Yōshin-ryū jujutsu to form\nWadō-ryū\nkarate, although the art would only later take on this name several years later.\n[\n1\n]\nWith recognition of his style as an independent karate style, Ōtsuka became a full-time instructor.\n[\n1\n]\nIn 1940, his style was registered at the Butokukai,\nKyoto\n, for the demonstration of various martial arts, together with Shotokan,\nShitō-ryū\n, and\nGōjū-ryū\n.\n[\n1\n]\nFollowing World War II, the practice of martial arts in Japan was banned.\n[\n11\n]\nAfter a few years, however, the ban was lifted; through the 1950s, Ōtsuka held various karate competitions.\n[\n12\n]\nIn 1964, three of Ōtsuka's students\nTatsuo Suzuki\n,\nToru Arakawa\n, and Hajime Takashima) from\nNihon University\ntoured Europe and the United States of America, demonstrating Wadō-ryū karate.\n[\n13\n]\nLater life\n[\nedit\n]\nOn April 29, 1966,\nEmperor\nHirohito\nawarded Ōtsuka the\nOrder of the Rising Sun, Fifth Class\nfor his contributions to karate.\n[\n1\n]\n[\n14\n]\nIn the next few years, Ōtsuka wrote two books on karate:\nKarate-Do, Volume 1\n(1967, focused on\nkata\n) and\nKarate-Do, Volume 2\n(1970, focused on\nkumite\n).\n[\n1\n]\nOn October 9, 1972, the Kokusai Budoin\nInternational Martial Arts Federation\n(IMAF Japan) awarded Ōtsuka the title of\nShodai Karate-do Meijin Judan\n(first-generation karate master 10th\ndan\n); this was the first time this honour had been bestowed on a karate practitioner.\n[\n1\n]\nOn March 22, 1970, Ōtsuka was presented with the\nkey to the City\nof\nNiagara Falls, NY\n.  Mayor E. Dent Lackey awarded Ōtsuka with the key to the city which was presented to Ōtsuka by one of his students (\nRobert Heisner\n, a\nNiagara Falls\nresident) who had recently been promoted to Nidan - Second Dan Black Belt by Ōtsuka.\n[\n15\n]\nŌtsuka continued to teach and lead Wadō-ryū karate into the 1980s, and died on January 29, 1982.\n[\n1\n]\nIn 1983, his son, Jiro Ohtsuka, became the second Grand Master of Wadō-ryū karate and honoured his father by taking the name \"Hironori Ōtsuka II.\"\nNotes\n[\nedit\n]\na.\n^\nŌtsuka's surname is sometimes also spelled as Ohtsuka.\nReferences\n[\nedit\n]\n^\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\nh\ni\nj\nk\nl\nm\nn\no\np\nq\nr\ns\n\"Grand Master Hironori Otsuka\"\n.

Ohtsuka was first introduced to martial arts by his great uncle, Chojiro Ebashi, a samurai warrior, who began teaching him jujitsu. When he was thirteen, he studied the style under Shinzaburo Nakayama, a grandmaster of jujitsu. He continued with his studies through school and university. In 1922 Ohtsuka met Gichin Funakoshi and began to learn more about karate while still continuing with his studies of jujitsu. Ohtsuka also studied other Japanese martial arts including judo, kendo and aikido. He blended the practical and useful elements of Okinawan karate with the techniques found in jujitsu and kendo, which led to the birth of kumite in karate. At this stage Ohtsuka thought that there was a need for this more dynamic and fluid type of karate to be taught, so he decided to leave Funakoshi to concentrate on developing his own style of karate-Wado. In 1934, Wado-ryu karate was officially recognized as an independent style of karate. Ohtsuka left his medical practice and became a full-time martial artist. In 1944, Ohtsuka was appointed Japan's Chief Karate Instructor.\n^\n\"Founder of Wado-Ryu - Hironori Otsuka\"\n(PDF)\n.\nwado-ryu.jp\n.\nArchived\n(PDF)\nfrom the original on 2018-06-13\n.
